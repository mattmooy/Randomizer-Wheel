# Hello!!
Heres how to adjust everything to what you would like
first, lets change the defualt message
Let me explain this first
This is your defualt message for when you leave a choice blank, this allows for custmizibility. For example,

a1 = "your deafualt message (please change before running)"

C1 = " "

if c1 == " ":
  c1 = a1

This makes it so that if you dont want to have all 12 choices, you dont have to, just leave it blank " "
It will automaticly make it print your deafualt message, Makes sense, right?

Next, lets change our choices.
we have 12 choices (you can add more below) these are deafualtly blank , or go straight to the defualt message "a1"
