This is the file for my randomizer I made, Feel free to copy and paste this and test it out!

# Hello!!
Heres how to adjust everything to what you would like
first, lets change the defualt message
Let me explain this first
This is your defualt message for when you leave a choice blank, this allows for custmizibility. For example,

a1 = "your deafualt message (please change before running)"

C1 = " "

if c1 == " ":                                                                                                                                                      p 
  c1 = a1

This makes it so that if you dont want to have all 12 choices, you dont have to, just leave it blank " "
It will automaticly make it print your deafualt message, Makes sense, right?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Next, lets change our choices.
we have 12 choices, these are deafualtly blank or, go straight to the defualt message "a1"

c1 = " "
c2 = " "
c3 = " "
c4 = " "
c5 = " "
c6 = " "
c7 = " "
c8 = " "
c9 = " "
c10 = " "
c11 = " "
c12 = " "

Whatever you fill these in with, they print, You can even put links in these.
once you fill these in, your pretty much done

This is advanced, If you dont know what your doing, dont touch it 

first, we are going to be adding more choices to the wheel
These are all in exspansion.txt so you can copy and paste these

So if we look, we only have 12 choices

c1 = " "
c2 = " "
c3 = " "
c4 = " "
c5 = " "
c6 = " "
c7 = " "
c8 = " "
c9 = " "
c10 = " "
c11 = " "
c12 = " "

If your up to the challenge, you may want to add more
first, make a variable (I sugest doing like c and the number choice it id like c13)

c1 = " "
c2 = " "
c3 = " "
c4 = " "
c5 = " "
c6 = " "
c7 = " "
c8 = " "
c9 = " "
c10 = " "
c11 = " "
c12 = " "
c13 = " "      add this

Next, we have to make the if statement so that we can have a defualt message
Please make sure your if statements are one line apart, other wise they will intersect and may fail

if c10 == " ":
	c10 = a1

if c11 == " ":
	c11 = a1

if c12 == " ":
	c12 = a1	
  
Ok lets put our if statement in

if c10 == " ":
	c10 = a1

if c11 == " ":
	c11 = a1

if c12 == " ":
	c12 = a1	
  
if c13 == " ":
  c13 = a1
Now we have our if statment working, but we dont have it being randomized

lista = [
	c1,
  c2, 
	c3, 
	c4, 
	c5, 
	c6, 
	c7, 
	c8, 
	c9, 
	c10, 
	c11, 
	c12]
  
Next, put our variable in our randomizer code

lista = [
	c1,
  c2, 
	c3, 
	c4, 
	c5, 
	c6, 
	c7, 
	c8, 
	c9, 
	c10, 
	c11, 
	c12,
  c13]
  
  Now, we have a New choice for our code.
